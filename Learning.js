/*

1.typeof operator is used to check what is the datatype of the value or variable
syntax:
   typeof value_or_variable

2.Uses:
  >>> Helps you debug your code — you know exactly what type of value you’re working with.

  >>> Helps avoid errors in calculations or operations (like adding a number and text accidentally).

  >>> Helps in conditional checks, e.g., “if this variable is a string, do X; if it’s a number, do Y.”
